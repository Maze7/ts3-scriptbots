# ts3-scriptbots
Some of my older TeamSpeak3-Scriptbots. Most of them was designed for MzHost and Biocrafting

There are two kinds of bots. 
**Serverbots** and **Clientbots**. 

* Serverbots are running on the server via ServerQuery. 
They need to be configured at least with ServerQuery credentials. 

* Clientbots doesnt connect to any Server. They use the local query port of TeamSpeak (maybe you need to turn it on). 
It is enough to start TeamSpeak3-Client and run the bot. 


They all was designed in the past with perl. Maybe there will be comming some new fresh bots with perl6/java/c++ in the future.... someday.
